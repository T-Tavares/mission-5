# init()

Init is a folder that holds anything that might be helpfull to understand the process and things done through the project.
Is more of a reference and refresh point for devs than anything.

Here you'll find articles, videos and other resources we used to learn.
You'll also find small txt files with instructions on how we got from A to B. (Mostly for things that took a while to crack and understand.)

Our Meetings are being documented on a json file as a database (agile-meetings.json) the idea is to have a small frontend page to display it nicely. If the available time allows us that.
